# weather_app

A useful project to learn how to develop basic UI in flutter.
Easy to understand if your have dart concepts especially in classes and constructors.

## Getting Started

1. I just have an appBar that has a title which is centered and an iconButton which is an actions property of AppBar().
2. Next I just have a body property of scaffold and in there I have a column widget since everything is stacked on top of each other.
3. The first component is a card with a blur effect and an elevation to make it look nice.
4. For the weather forecast cards, I have created a separate folder and re-used the card widget to reduce amount of code in my main file.
5. The same goes for additional information which is not an iteration of cards

## You're new to flutter ?

Don't worry at this point I am also learning how flutter works.
